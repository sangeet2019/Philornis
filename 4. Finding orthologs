We used tool Orthofinder (https://github.com/davidemms/OrthoFinder) for phylogenetic orthology inference and carry out comparative genomics analysis of P. downsi with other published dipteran genomes.

1. Copy protein fasta file generated from P. downsi genome annotation pipeline into a separate folder "Proteomes"
2. Download protein fasta files from other dipteran genomes from Ensembl into the same "Proteome" folder
